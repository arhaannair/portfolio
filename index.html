        <section class="about-text">
          <p>
            I'm an IT student with real-world experience supporting technical infrastructure through internships,
            particularly in healthcare settings. I’ve worked on systems administration, user support, and resolving
            everyday IT challenges in fast-paced environments.
          </p>

          <p>
            I enjoy being the person people rely on when systems fail — whether it’s configuring accounts,
            troubleshooting networks, or ensuring day-to-day operations run smoothly. My goal is to build a long-
            term career in healthcare IT, where technology directly supports people and outcomes.

                  Bachelor of Science in Information Technology degree program with ASU. Arhaan has an easy-going and determined 
                  manner matched with dogged persistence in applying himself in his IT courses, as well as, his valuable tutoring 
                  assistance with his fellow ASU students supporting the bigger picture successfulness with the university!

                  Arhaan was instrumental in helping me bring my vision for Soulful Tribe’s online presence to life. He worked
                  closely with me to design a user-friendly website that reflects the spirit of the business and meets the needs
                  of our growing community. His technical skills, professionalism, and thoughtful communication made the
                  process smooth from start to finish. I’m very grateful for his work and would gladly recommend him to
                  anyone looking for reliable, high-quality support in building their digital presence.

It’s about protecting patient safety. A ransomware attack that takes down a hospital’s systems can delay critical surgeries, interrupt prescriptions, and compromise care.&#10;&#10;This is why healthcare IT teams go beyond antivirus software.

     data-text="When I first got into IT, I didn’t expect to find myself drawn to healthcare. I was fascinated by systems, automation, and troubleshooting — but it was during an internship at a public health agency that everything clicked. I realized that behind every medical record, patient appointment, and lab result is a network of IT infrastructure quietly keeping people safe and cared for.&#10;&#10;Healthcare IT feels purposeful in a way that few other sectors do. Every ticket resolved, device deployed, or system upgraded directly impacts someone’s ability to receive treatment or deliver care. I’ve worked on projects that supported mobile clinics, optimized databases for vaccine tracking, and helped improve digital literacy for staff in underserved areas. Each experience reinforced how essential tech is to public health — not as a background tool, but as a core part of the mission.&#10;&#10;What excites me most is how rapidly health tech is evolving. From electronic health records and secure patient portals to AI diagnostics and telemedicine, the future of healthcare is digital. I want to be part of that transformation — building systems that are not only efficient but equitable, secure, and accessible.&#10;&#10;Choosing IT in healthcare wasn’t a pivot. It was the natural intersection of the skills I enjoy using and the impact I want to make.">

     data-text="When I started working help desk, I thought I was just learning how to fix things. And I was — I learned how to troubleshoot VPN errors, reset user credentials, reinstall printers, and explain Office 365 settings more times than I can count. But what surprised me was how much I learned about people, processes, and priorities along the way.&#10;&#10;IT support is often the first line of defense — and the first line of connection — between users and tech. Every support ticket was a small window into how a department worked, what systems they relied on, and where their pain points were. I learned to listen first, ask the right questions, and tailor my solutions to fit not just the technical issue but the user’s level of comfort and urgency.&#10;&#10;That front-line experience taught me soft skills I never expected to gain in a technical role: empathy, clarity, patience, and resilience. It also helped me understand larger systems thinking — why certain issues repeated, what patterns to watch for, and how documentation or automation could prevent future problems.&#10;&#10;Help desk work isn’t just entry-level — it’s foundational. It shapes how you think about IT as a service, not just a system.">

     data-date="April 29, 2025"
     data-category="Web Development"
     data-text="Building my portfolio website was one of the most rewarding (and occasionally frustrating) personal projects I’ve taken on. I went in thinking it would be a simple task — choose a template, tweak some code, and hit publish. But as with most tech projects, reality had other plans.&#10;&#10;First, I underestimated how long customization would take. I wanted something that reflected my personality but still looked professional, and that meant diving deep into HTML, CSS, and a little JavaScript. I broke the layout more than once, misaligned icons, and forgot to make it mobile-friendly at first.&#10;&#10;Then came the form. I spent way too long trying to connect a simple contact form to Google Sheets and make it send without redirecting the user. After debugging scripts and permissions, I finally got it to work — and learned a lot about asynchronous requests and UI feedback along the way.&#10;&#10;Deploying was another learning curve. Hosting it on GitHub Pages was smooth, but setting up the custom domain and SSL took trial and error. The process forced me to understand DNS records, HTTPS certs, and how to troubleshoot web deployment issues on my own.&#10;&#10;In the end, the mistakes were the best part — because I fixed them. Now the site doesn’t just showcase my work; it represents how I solve problems, learn quickly, and care about doing things right.">
